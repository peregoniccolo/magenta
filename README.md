# Magenta Gansynth offline tool
Developed to be part of the CPaC project Synthesia. 

## Env setup
To create the environment you'll need follow the steps <a href="https://github.com/magenta/magenta">here</a>. Refer to the "w/o Anaconda" sections. 

Note that if after you tried the automated installation with conda, the magenta package is not in the conda list of your environment, you'll need to procede with the manual installation.

If you want to work locally with/on the notebook <a href="gansynth_external.ipynb">gansynth_external</a> (adaptation of the colab notebook by magenta, which btw does not work anymore out of the box) you'll need to install the `ipykernel` package.
